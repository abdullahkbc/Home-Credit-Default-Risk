In the end, we have a 974 variables. \n","We used 2 types of models: XGBoost and LightGBM. \n","We also calculate the feature importance. Almost 1/3 of variables have zero importance. We run LightGBM on both data: dropped and non-dropped versions. As expected, the dropped version gives better results.\n","Comparing these two models, XGBoost is much more slow than LightGBM. LightGBM gives higher accuracy and AUC score.
